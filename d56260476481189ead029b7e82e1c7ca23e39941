      "message": "This is still wrong. We should handle for _both_ types deploy scenarios. This will happen when when a project is in transition from nexus to s3 deploys as we will want to do some side by side while we verify that logs are properly shipping during the conversion. Doing Nexus logs first would be my preference (to match what we\u0027re doing with global-jjb).\n\nIn addition, in both cases the buildDesc needs to be properly taken care of to handle both cases. Either, you default it above, like I mentioned, _or_ and maybe this is better, do a final check after both of these for an empty buildDesc and set it to the no log string at that time. If this is the selected method, then the storage handlers just need to appropriately extend the string ;)",
