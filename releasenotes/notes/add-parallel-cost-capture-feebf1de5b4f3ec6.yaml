    New global var lfParallelCostCapture. This is a function to be run as a
    "post" call at the end of each stage within a parallel block, which will
    gather cost data from dynamically-allocated build nodes. It outputs a file
    titled "stack-cost" and stashes it. lfInfraShipLogs has been modified to
    unstash this file, which will automatically be picked up by the job-cost.sh
    script.
